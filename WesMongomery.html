    <h1>Wesmongomery</h1>
    <p>John Leslie "Wes" Montgomery (March 6, 1923 – June 15, 1968) 
        as an American jazz guitarist. <br>[1]  Montgomery was known for an 
        unusual technique of plucking the strings with the side of his thumb 
        and his extensive use of octaves, 
        <br> which gave him a distinctive sound. <br>
        Montgomery often worked with his brothers Buddy (Charles F.) 
        and Monk (William H.) and with organist Melvin Rhyne. <br>
        His recordings up to 1965 were oriented towards hard bop, soul jazz, and post bop, <br> but around 1965 he began recording more pop-oriented instrumental 
        albums that found mainstream success. <br> His later guitar style influenced jazz fusion and smooth jazz.
